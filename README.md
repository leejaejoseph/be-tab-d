# be tab’d: CSV to Relational Database Tables Web Application

Welcome to be tab’d! This is a full stack web application for CSV file uploaders who want to organize files into relational database tables.

As a software developer who is interested in backend development, I wanted to build a project that would help me gain a deeper understanding of working with data and databases. I created be tab’d, a web application that allows users to upload CSV files and convert them into relational database tables. While the project currently requires users to upload a set collection of CSV file, my plan is to improve the project by making it automatically parse CSV files with a multitude of headers. Through building this project, I have learned a lot about backend technologies such as PostgreSQL, as well as how to structure and manipulate data in the backend. I am excited to continue improving this project and applying my newfound knowledge to future projects.
