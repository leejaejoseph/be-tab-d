        be tabâ€™d is a tool to convert a csv file to a relational database and is soon to organize your docs/pdf files into folders by keywords.
        I wanted to build a project that would help me gain a deeper understanding of working with data and databases.

        While the project currently requires users to upload a set collection of CSV file, my plan is to improve the project by making it automatically parse CSV files with a multitude of headers. Through building this project, I have learned a lot about backend technologies such as PostgreSQL, as well as how to structure and manipulate data in the backend. I am excited to continue improving this project and applying my newfound knowledge to future projects.
